[resume](https://github.com/davclark/dav-cv/raw/master/DavClark-Focused-Resume.pdf))
is the director of Glass Bead Labs. He is appointed as a research scientist at
the [Center for Neurodevelopmental and Imaging Research
(CNIR)](http://cnir.kennedykrieger.org), building on his role as a
co-investigator for an
[NIMH-funded trial](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02234557) at
[Kennedy Krieger
Institute](http://www.kennedykrieger.org/research-training/movement-based-mindfulness-training-children-adhd-feasibility-study)
evaluating the impacts of taiji on adolescents with ADHD. He also maintains a
productive collaboration with [SHO-zemi Innovation
Ventures](http://www.sziv.org/lab.html) to develop the use of lightweight
mobile and web-based approaches to assessing social-emotional and cognitive
factors in tutoring classrooms. More broadly, Dav has been engaged with
innovation in social and physical measurement, hosting round-tables with
[BITSS](https://youtu.be/nfmR7HS5qCs?t=30s) and
[DIL](http://dil.berkeley.edu/data-analytics-toolkits/mobile-data-collection-webinar-series/) and leading instruction for
["Hacking Measurement"](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu/).

**Sebastian Benthall**
