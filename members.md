## Direction

**Dav Clark, Ph.D.**
([CV](https://github.com/davclark/dav-cv/raw/master/complete-current-CV.pdf),
[resume](https://github.com/davclark/dav-cv/raw/master/DavClark-Focused-Resume.pdf))
is the director of Glass Bead Labs. He is appointed as a research scientist at
the [Center for Neurodevelopmental and Imaging Research
(CNIR)](http://cnir.kennedykrieger.org), building on his role as a
co-investigator for an
[NIMH-funded trial](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02234557) at
[Kennedy Krieger
Institute](http://www.kennedykrieger.org/research-training/movement-based-mindfulness-training-children-adhd-feasibility-study)
evaluating the impacts of taiji on adolescents with ADHD. He also maintains a
productive collaboration with [SHO-zemi Innovation
Ventures](http://www.sziv.org/lab.html) to develop the use of lightweight
mobile and web-based approaches to assessing social-emotional and cognitive
factors in tutoring classrooms. More broadly, Dav has been engaged with
innovation in social and physical measurement, hosting round-tables with
[BITSS](https://youtu.be/nfmR7HS5qCs?t=30s) and
[DIL](http://dil.berkeley.edu/data-analytics-toolkits/mobile-data-collection-webinar-series/) and leading instruction for
["Hacking Measurement"](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu/).

**Jean-Olivier Richard, Ph.D.**
([UofT page](https://stmikes.utoronto.ca/profile/jean-olivier-richard/))
is a fellow of Glass Bead Labs. He is an Assistant Professor of 
Christianity and Science at St. Michael’s College in the University of Toronto.
His research focuses on polymathic enterprises of the early modern era, 
Enlightenment philosophy, and Jesuit history. He is currently writing a book 
on the universal system of 18th-century Jesuit mathematician and philosopher 
Louis-Bertrand Castel, and he joins Glass Beads Labs with the goal of bringing
historical insight into the development of VR and volumetric capture tools
to facilitate multidisciplinary research and the teaching of mathematics and physics.
